<h1>Intro to Programming</h1>

There are 5 ways of thinking:

<p><b>Procedural Thinking</b> --> Involves creating perfectly clear & unambiguous
  <br>
  instructions for a computer to follow.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Abstract Thinking</b> --> Means finding similarity, generality amongst
  <br>
  seemingly different things.
</p>

<p>
<b>System Thinking</b> --> Break a big problem into smaller pieces.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Technological Thinking</b> --> The ability to understand what a 
  computer is & works.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Debugging</b> --> Systematic process of relentlessly identifying the
  <br>
  cause of why a programm does not work.
</p>

Important Concepts  
</h2>

<p>
<h3>Wolrd Wide Web (www)</h3>
The <em>www</em> is a huge collection of <em>HTML</em> Documents, it was invented
in 1990s. There are more
<br>
than 300 billion pages.
<br>
Everything can exist on the web, but the HTML files are the basis.

<p>
  <b>HTTP</b>
  <br>
  The main protocol of the Web
</p>

<p>
  <b>Servers</b>
  <br>
  Componets that host files that make up the web
</p>

<p>
  <b>Internet</b>
  <br>
  The world largest Computer Network
</p>

<p>
  <b>Browser</b>
  <br>
  A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the Web
</p>

<br>

<p>
  <h3>HTML</h3>
  HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> it is what you see on your
  <br>
  browser. This is how it work:
  <p>
    Text content --> What you see
    <br>
    Markup --> What it looks like
    <br>
    References to other Documents --> images + videos + etc.
    <br>
    Links to other pages --> 
    <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>
  </p>
</p>

<p>
HTML Markup is made up of things called <b>tags</b>.
<br><br>
<<name>tag name>content<</name>/tag name>
<br>
-------------------<b>element</b>--------------------
</p>

Almost every tag should use a closing tag, except the ones that has no content,
<br>this tag without a closing tag are called <b>void tags</b>.

<p>
  <b>Inline & Block elements</b>
  <br><br>
  The difference is that in <em>Block elements</em> the content is inside like the tags in the last image.
